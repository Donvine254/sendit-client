          The Services
        </p>
        <p>
          The Services provided by sendIT enable users to arrange the
          collection, storage, packaging, and preparation of goods for delivery
          to their consignees. Please note that the delivery services offered
          through the Services are provided by independent third-party
          transporters (the &quot;Transporters&quot;). Sendit acts as a
          facilitator, and using the Services does not establish Sendit as a
          provider of delivery, courier, or logistics services or as a logistics
          carrier. In exchange for the fees communicated by Sendit and following
          the manner described in these Terms, Sendit will provide the Services
          as outlined in this Agreement. The Services are available on-demand,
          and users must place an order through their sendIT Account by
          providing accurate information requested by Sendit. This may include:
          Pickup address for the goods Destination address for delivery Contact
          details of the consignee Description of the goods A Transporter will
          be assigned to collect and deliver the goods to a Sendit designated
          warehouse or goods holding area. Users can manage and track their
          orders through their sendIT Account. The Transporter may request a
          physical verification of the goods before pickup to ensure they match
          the provided description. If any discrepancies are found, the
          Transporter will decline the receipt and notify Sendit. Sendit offers
          storage services for goods at its designated warehouses. Users may
          make a delivery request to a specified consignee, and a Transporter
          will be dispatched for collection and delivery. Consignees have the
          option to postpone delivery for up to two days. If a delivery cannot
          be completed due to consignee availability or postponement, the goods
          will be returned to the warehouse, and the order status will be
          updated. In case of accidents or incidents while goods are in
          Sendit&apos;s or the Transporter&apos;s possession, Sendit will notify
          the user. Sendit reserves the right to charge storage fees for goods
          held beyond a minimum period. Goods delivered to consignees will be
          sealed, and once accepted, the order will be marked as complete. It is
          important to note that Sendit&apos;s contractual relationship is with
          the user, not the consignee. In case of consignee returns, the user
          may approve the return, and Sendit can assist in delivering the return
          to the user under a separate transaction. If users need to return
          warehoused goods through the Services, they can place a request
          through their Account, and Sendit will communicate the delivery
          details. A fee may be charged for such returns.

          Payment Terms
        </p>
        <p>
          Fulfillment fees for the Services will be communicated through the
          Services. Users must pay Sendit for the Services&apos; fulfillment
          fees in advance and in full prior to the completion of a delivery,
          following one of these options: On-pay: Paying the amounts quoted by
          Sendit through the Services before placing delivery requests or
          immediately upon delivery conclusion. Pre-pay: Topping up your sendIT
          account with an amount to cover delivery fees. Payments can be made
          via bank transfer, mobile money transfer, or other agreed digital
          methods. Cash payments are not accepted unless expressly advised by
          Sendit. Fees are exclusive of any applicable taxes, which you agree to
          pay in addition to the fees. Sendit may, at its discretion, adjust its
          fees based on various criteria, including geographical location, time
          period, or demand quantity. Users understand that such adjustments may
          result in different charges for similar services obtained through the
          Services. Sendit may offer promotional offers with different features
          and rates to certain customers, but these offers will not affect your
          contract or the charges applicable to you unless explicitly made to
          you. Sendit may, at its discretion, allow users to post-pay for the
          Services under agreed terms, provided that all fees for Services must
          be settled within 24 hours of service provision.
